# Chat
Chat is a (you guessed it) chat program I created.  I am handling the bug tracking in GitHub.

The current version is 0.2

If you would like to view the issues currently open, click on the ! in a circle.  You will then be able to see the currently open issues.  Everything has a slightly different priority, so they will probably not be fixed in order.

If you find a bug, please let me know!  I'll try to get around to it.
